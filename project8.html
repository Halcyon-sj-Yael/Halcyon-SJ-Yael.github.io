                <p>Project Description: While creating this logo I had in mind that it was going to be like a Yugio card with a monster but I remembered that I had a drawing in my sketchbook that I wanted to make and I did there were a lot of changes with the color I was playing around with colors with this one I have their variation of it with different colors and hopefully I make this as a benny or a hoody it will look nice or even a sticker.</p>
