                <p>Project Description: Why did I create this persona? because issues of identity and self-acceptance may be explored via Halcyon's battle with his looks and the necessity of wearing a mask. His narrative may center on his quest to accept and comprehend who he is despite social expectations. Moreover, Halcyon's choice to wear the mask might be interpreted in your narrative as a signal. The act of donning or wearing a mask can signify disobedience or personal progress. It can also reflect the masks people wear in society to blend in or protect themselves.</p>
