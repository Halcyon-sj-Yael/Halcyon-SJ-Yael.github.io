                <p>Project Description: It was difficult for me to create the animated landscape that the project produced because I had no idea what to do, had run out of ideas, and had decided to animate two UFOs crossing paths in space to different locations, which meant that each of them was a different location. What made this difficult was that each time I tried to animate the stars, it would stop or not move, which allowed it to be made inaccurately. I would subsequently return and try to edit the style on it, adding more elements that could be said, still in progress.</p>
