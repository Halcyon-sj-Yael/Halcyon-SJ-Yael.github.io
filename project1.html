                <p>Project Description: To create these images use Photoshop and the tools used in Photoshop are the move tool and lasso tool. The two images are from a one-piece character who is to be the king of the pirates and his name is Luffy. But the images that you see are two different from the first image with Sound Audacity Making the Glish form was a bit difficult because did what worked and didn't know what I was doing wrong the glitch part later on I figured out that I forgot a step with the soundAudacity and that did the waves and a liked it glitch part. I grabbed an image from Google and decided to make it gray because it looked nice this image is when I believe he got to fight Kaido and the glitch image is when he gets new powers but from that I used the lasso tool to copy the part of the glitch image and moved tool on the other image to make it what you see before you.</p>
